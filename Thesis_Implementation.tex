\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chapter:implementation}

This section will go in depth on the implementation of the concepts presented in the chapter \ref{chapter:background}. The plane model to be controlled was firstly implemented and verified. The first goal after this first step was to design a controller that would allow the aircraft to follow a trajectory from several position waypoints through time. The influence of certain parameters and knowledge of the exact plane model will be studied and discussed in chapter \ref{chapter:results}. The final goal will be to improve the controller and its robustness by reducing tracking error through the use of an adaptive neural network.

\section{Plane Model}
\label{section:model}

The chosen commercial aircraft that will be simulated is the Boeing 737-200, an aircraft with over 30 years of service for which information of flight parameters is readily available.
